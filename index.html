			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<div id="letter-content">
			<p>Fields of Brass is a ska-punk band hailing from Kingsburg California. Guitarist Matt Bartel called up Josh Lund one day because he wanted to compete in the local Battle of the Bands competition. After hearing this, Josh called up Garrett Marshall because they had jammed in a couple different garage bands, but nothing ever substantial came out of it. Garrett has always envisioned being in a ska band, and this was his chance to make it happen. 
			Fun fact, the name Fields of Brass is actually a rearranged version of our friend's last name, which is Brassfield. Josh was the one who brought this idea up to Garrett, and he liked it, even though the reference completely flew over his head.
			The Battle of the Bands turned out to be Fields of Brass playing two covers and an original, while an already established alternative rock band played two entire sets. Despite their small set, playing in front of an audience and creating music was something that each member enjoyed doing, and they stated to write song, after song, after song. 
			Fields of Brass released Boom! Shocka-Locka. on May 17 2013. In December 2013, they released the Pots and Pans EP. They are currently brainstorming for a new album that is unlike anything they have ever made!
